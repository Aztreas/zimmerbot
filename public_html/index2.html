        <p>
        The analytalks project is a <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org"> Wikimedia Tools Labs</a>
	project for generating a real-time sentiment network of editor conversations for visual spam detection.
        </p>

	<h3>process flow</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li> Extract recently updated user talk pages from the English Wikipedia's MySQL DB </li>
	  <li> Run a sentiment classifier on the most recent page diff of above pages<br /> The sentiment classifier was trained on the rotten tomatoes movie review dataset</li>
	  <li> Create a network of the user conversations and store in json format with metadata</li>
	  <li> Visualise using a <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045">force-directed graph</a>  created with <a href="https://d3js.org">d3.js</a></li>
	</ol>
	  The code is written in Python. You can clone the source from <a href="http://tools-static.wmflabs.org/analytalks/analytalks.git">here</a>.
	  Current attempts at creating a data visualisation can be seen <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/analytalks/graph.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>what's next ?</h3>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Spam Detection
		<ol>
		  <li>convert visual spam detection to analytical spam detection(predict spamming users by anomaly detection? and tag them on the network)</li>
		  <li>filter network to show only spamming users and their conversations based networks instead of the most recent 100 or whatever</li>
		</ol>
	    </li>
	    <li>Community Detection
	      <ol>
		<li>community detection using louvain method</li>
		<li>use community detection to categorise network communications(one group dedicated to one spammer or something)</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
